WatchKitForcedModal
===================

This is an attempt to recreated the 1Password passcode "modal". Theirs is not a true modal since it cannot be dismissed by the user, hence the "forced" modal term.

This approached uses a set of explicitly sized top-level groups, with only one being visible at any time:

* Passcode - keypad buttons
* Animation - images to animate a fake modal dismissal
* Content
